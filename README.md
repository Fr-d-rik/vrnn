done:
build VAE, run on mnist

in progress:
build VRNN, test on artificial data-set

to do:
find appropriate data-set
try and get RGP implementation running
take look at data sets from rgp paper

next steps:
get weight saving done
move run script to function(s)
train minimal version to get results
write generative version
run check function

set up amlab server
think of decent model parameters, net sizes
train for real
run check
parameter changes
